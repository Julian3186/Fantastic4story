    // After getting settled in his home Kevin reflected on the eventful day he had with his son. Now having a clutch victory for both his favorite team and for his relationship with his son. “This day couldn’t have gone any better!” He thought to himself as he sat in his favorite seat. Kevin was pleased that he was able to complete his mission of creating lasting memories. He thought about other games he and his son could attend and hoped that maybe one day David would do the same with his children in the future. He looked over to Marsha and said “Honey you have to come to the next game with us, the win today was one for the books.” To which Marsha replied “ Of course, and next time we’ll bring the whole family!”.
